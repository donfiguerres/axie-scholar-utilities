This software's intent is to automate all activities related to manage Scholars. It is specially aimed to mangers with large scholar roasters.
As of now it has the following commands:

- Generate Secrets (Helper to generate secrets.json file)
- SLP Claim
- Automatic Payouts

To know how to use it, install it, please visit the [wiki](https://ferranmarin.github.io/axie-scholar-utilities/)


# How is this and future developments financed?

There is embedded in the code a 1% fee. I believe this is a fair charge for this automation. It allows me to dedicate time and effort on bettering this software and add more features! Please do not remove it as it is the only way I have to support this project.

# Roadmap

- Add capability to payout from accounts with Trezor (needs investigation)
- Add automatic breeding
- Integrate with Discord (via a bot, maybe?)
- Release a desktop app (even more convenient)
- ...
- Add functionality to get QR codes, maybe(?)

Feel free to open issues requesting features. I will consider all of them and maybe add them in the future!
